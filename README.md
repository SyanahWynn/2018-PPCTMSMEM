# The posterior parietal cortex and subjectively perceived confidence during memory retrieval
Here you will find the experimental design and analysis script used in the aformentioned published paper. The scripts were not created to be widely used by others, so may not be user-friendly. The scripts were altered by deleting redundancy and remove participant-specific steps. In this way, readability and generalizability has increased.

# Experimental Design
The experimental design was created and used in PsychoPy (v1.80). Input files are needed to input the stimuli, which are not added here.

# Data Analysis script
Here you will find the analysis script used to process the data for subsequent statistical tests. This version is an adjusted version of the script, which is altered after the publication to improve readability. The ROC toolbox for MATLAB (Koen et al. 2016) is needed to get d-prime, and familiarity & recollection estimates.
